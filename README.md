# CWidgets
This is a collection of my custom PyQt5 Widgets. The purpose of this repository is to provide higher level / more specialized widgets for use with Python 3 and PyQt5. Mild effort will be made to support Python 2 (such as the super calls), but I do not intend to support Python 2. The project should also in theory be portable to PyQt4 by changing imports and tweaking where you need to, but no official support is planned for PyQt4 either.
