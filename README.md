# CWIDGETS FOR PYQT5 / PYTHON 3

This is a collection of my custom PyQt5 Widgets. The purpose of this repository is to provide higher level / more specialized widgets for use with Python 3 and PyQt5. Keep in mind that I am currently learning PyQt5, so any contributions to improve the usability / functionality of the Widgets is welcome.

## Current Widgets:
  * Alarm Lock Widget
  * Labelled Prompt Dialog
  * Multiple Choice Widget
  * Progress Task Dialog
  * Console Output Widget
  * Live Clock Widget
