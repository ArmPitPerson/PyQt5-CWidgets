# CWIDGETS FOR PYQT5 / PYTHON 3

This is a collection of my custom PyQt5 Widgets. The purpose of this repository is to provide higher level / more specialized widgets for use with Python 3 and PyQt5. While I try to keep support for most Python 3 versions, I do sometimes use features that were introduced in Python 3.6, and do not guarantee compability with older versions, although the changes to make it work should be really minor. Keep in mind that I am currently learning PyQt5, so any contributions to improve the usability / functionality of the Widgets is welcome.

## Current Widgets:
  * Alarm Lock Widget
  * Labelled Prompt Dialog
  * Multiple Choice Widget
  * Progress Task Dialog
  * Console Output Widget
  * Live Clock Widget

### Notices
Some widgets rely on Python 3.6 string formatting:

`f"This is {variable} number {id}"`
